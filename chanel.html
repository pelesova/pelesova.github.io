                    <p>Just three weeks ago in April, fashion’s favorite DJ Michel Gaubert (@michelgaubert) raised a furor among the AAPI community when he posted a video featuring himself and friends holding up slant-eyed paper masks while yelling “Wuhan girls, wahoo!.” Industry influencer Susie Lau (@susiebubble) was among the first to publicly blast the @chanelofficial soundscape designer, calling the masks “patently racist” and likening it to “an Asian version of blackface.” </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p> Other Asian influencers and friends of the French luxury house were quick to chime in. “This is the most tasteless & ignorant thing I’ve ever seen,” said South Korean influencer Irene Kim (@ireneisgood). Brian Boy (@bryanboy), who is of Filipino descent, underscored the incident occurring during a troubling climate where violence towards Asian Americans have spiked. Chinese American influencer @tinachencraig said “his insincere non-apology is almost as offensive as his ‘Wuhan girl’ party video post.” </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p>But despite the scandal that saw the DJ post two apologies (he deleted his first), it seems it’s business as usual for Gaubert and his most high-profile client, Chanel. Ahead of the brand’s Resort 2022 show, Bruno Pavlovsky, non-Asian president of Chanel, has even accepted Gaubert’s apology, as reported by @wwd. “Michel is a talented man who’s very respectful of others, and he’s apologized for his actions. He is mortified, because he never intended to offend anyone. He’s a long-term partner of the house, and you don’t abandon a partner because of an incident,” he said. </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p>“We know Michel well. He’s a fine man with real values, so there’s no reason for us not to continue our collaboration with him, which stretches back over many years,” he added, while assuring that the brand does not tolerate racism of any form. </p>
