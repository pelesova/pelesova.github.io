                    <p>Wow @MTV … the lengths that huge corporations will go to to minimize anti-Asian racism, misogyny, and harassment in the name of white supremacy. Following the hate crime that resulted in the murder of 6 Asian women in the Atlanta area, members of the Asian American community are speaking up about their experiences facing racism. </p>
                    <P>In an Instagram post, former MTV correspondent Suchin Pak (@SuchinPak), who worked at the network from 2001-2008, revealed that she was involved in a legal dispute with a male colleague. "Years ago... I overheard a colleague of mine, while watching me do the news that evening tell a room full of people that I looked like a ‘me sucky sucky love you long time’ whore,” Pak said. “I was young, afraid as usual to cause a fuss or be seen as difficult or too ‘sensitive’ being the only female in the news room, so I didn’t say anything in the moment.”</P>
                    <P>Pak detailed fighting back a "reconciliation," which involved a written letter from the colleague. “One last attempt was made to ask me to swallow my dignity, my identity, my rage to make a white man feel like he was still ok, loved and respected,” she said. “I was reminded once again by the white male executive, that someone’s livelihood was on the line, that I was somehow responsible for that." She walked out and never opened the letter.</P>
                    <p>While Pak’s statement doesn’t go into specifics, it’s possible that a lawyer was retained in a hostile work environment, sexual harassment, or employment discrimination case. “Before the #metoo era, trying to settle privately was almost universal, since even when plaintiffs won, news of a lawsuit could result in their being branded troublemakers and ruining their careers,” says Professor Susan Scafidi, founder and director of the @fashionlawinstitute at Fordham. “Sadly still the case, however many times whistleblowers are hailed as heroes.”</p>
                    <p>Pak also shared some words of hope. “As many of you are shaking with fear, uncertainty and anger… know that in the midst of feeling small and invisible, you have a deep sense of dignity, of self worth," she said. "Holding onto that in the darkest of places is enough.”</p>
