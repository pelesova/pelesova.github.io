            <H1>ITALIAN TV NETWORK RAI HAS FINALLY BANNED BLACKFACE</H1>

                    <p>Donning blackface on national TV has been par for the course for participants on Rai1’s ‘Tale e quale show’, a talent show where celebrity contestants impersonate other performers, with the winnings going to charities of their choice. Since 2012, participating celebrities have gone to great lengths to do accurate impersonations, working with acting and vocal coaches… and makeup artists that have aided in some racist choices being made. Now, the network has promised to ban blackface from its shows. </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p> Many American celebrities have been subjected to Tale e quale’s blackface interpretations, including Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Beyoncé, but one of the most recent was Italian actor Sergio Muniz performing in blackface as Italian rapper @Ghali back in November. Born in Milan to Tunisian parents, the rapper and producer spoke out on social media about the racist way he was portrayed on the show. He captioned an Instagram post with “Bastava l’autotune e un bel look. Non c’è bisogno di fare il BlackFace per imitare me o altri artisti”, which translates to “Autotune and a good look were enough. There is no need to do the BlackFace to imitate me or other artists.“ </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p>Afro-Italians have been expressing their discontent for years, and in January multiple groups banded together to make a public appeal to RAI’s managers. The #CambieRai initiative was launched, aimed at underlining how racism was a big problem on public television. RAI, or Radiotelevisione italiana, is Italy’s national public broadcasting company. Owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, they operate multiple TV channels and radio stations that broadcast in Italy and around the world. Rai1 channel has broadcast ‘Tale e quale’ since 2012, but according to a statement made yesterday, contestants will be banned from performing in blackface. </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p>Some Italian media is mentioning all the Italian performers that donned blackface, almost as historical precedent, but not all history should be upheld. To see RAI take this step of acknowledging the racism and banning blackface is progress.</p>
