                    <p>Last summer, #FreeBritney gained momentum as fans united to call an end to an oppressive court-mandated conservatorship controlled by her father Jamie Spears since 2008. In February 2021, ahead of a pivotal court hearing, the release of Samantha Stark’s ’Framing Britney Spears’ documentary on Hulu forced the world to reassess the culture that exploited the young woman and reveled in her breakdown. </p>
                    <P>The documentary was well-received and an outpouring of support came from fans and celebrities like Dua Lipa, Kim Kardashian, and will.i.am, dominating conversations online and off. Now, it seems more networks are looking to capitalize on that buzz. On April 21, Britney fan twitter account ‘Spears Central’ released the names of four documentaries in the works, from a part 2 from Hulu, to ones from Netflix and the BBC, which plans to air theirs in early May.</P>
                    <P>Though ‘Framing Britney Spears’ was viewed as helpful towards her battle in reclaiming autonomy, fans are questioning whether additional documentaries play into the same exploitation Spears has faced, as Buzzfeed reports. Twitter user @ mikechvng , who previously worked at a documentary company, said “they just kept talking about how they can make it into a film. these people really don't care.” Another, @ audreyhorned tweeted “This is not what she needs. They are doing exactly what the media did years ago: exploiting her and not offering any real help.”</P>
                    <P>After the Hulu documentary premiered, Spears said via Instagram that she felt "embarrassed," but fans remain skeptical about the authorship. Billy Brasfield, a former makeup artist, even told Page Six that he personally spoke to Britney and that she had no control over the caption. “The content is her, but … the words are NOT how she feels."</P>
                    <P>In Spears' first hearing after the airing, Judge Brenda Penny rejected her father’s objection to sharing control of her estate, rendering Bessemer Trust equal power as co-conservator. As Spears and her attorney seek to remove her father as conservator entirely, here’s to hoping the upcoming docus will shed further light onto his character, versus replaying the same traumas Britney endured.</P>
