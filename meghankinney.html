                    <p>Newsflash Meghan Kinney @megbymeghankinney : No one cares if your business suffered during the pandemic if you’ve exploited indie creators for your personal gain. Following Brendan Fagan aka @JudithSupine ’s call out, Brazilian artist João Incerti ( @o_incerto ) is speaking out about having his work stolen by Meghan Kinney for her fashion line Meg. </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p> In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Incerti showed an image of his work against Kinney’s pieces, which featured his print without his authorization. “This is one of my most loved arts called ‘Cachos de Tucano’ in portuguese and ‘Crazy Toucans’ in english,” the artist said. “Sometimes we get used to people copying our job, it happens more often that you can imagine, but @diet_prada made me found this one and i decided to post this time. Hope you hire your own surface designer soon“ </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p>Incerti’s design, which features a colorful array of toucans, monstera, and spotted bananas, appeared on a jumpsuit, skirt, and jacket from Kinney’s line, the latter two of which were priced between $249-$289. </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p>In an interview with Advantage Austria in February 2020, Kinney described her customer as a woman who “has an independent sense of style, prefers to buy locally, enjoys independent design.” When asked how she feels when seeing people in her “designs”, the she said “I feel always so flattered that a woman has made a decision to put on something I made that day.”</p>
                    <p>Kinney has come a long way from planting roots as an indie designer in the East Village in the mid-1990s. The FIT-trained student’s business has since grown to include five stores in NYC and one in Toronto… enough time to pick up some super shady habits, but apparently not enough to figure out how to hire their own print designer.</p>
