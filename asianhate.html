                    <p>Monday night on the Italian satirical TV show Striscia la Notizia, hosts Gerry Scotti and Michelle Hunziker introduced a segment on Italian national broadcasting company RAI’s headquarters in Beijing.</p>
                    <P>Gerry Scotti (@GerryScotti), a former member of the Italian Parliament, and @TheRealHunzigram , a Swiss-Italian actress and model, began by mocking Chinese people’s pronunciation of the letter R, calling the network “LAI” instead of “RAI.” The hosts then proceeded to pull the corners of their eyes up in the manner of common racist gestures meant to caricaturize Asian features. At one point, with eyes pinched up, Hunziker spoke in gibberish. </P>
                    <p>The episode’s broadcast received 4,662,000 views according to Auditel, a company that measures Italian TV data. @StriscialaNotizia airs on Canale 5, a television channel of Mediaset, a right-wing mass media company owned by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.</p>
                    <p>Reputationally, both Scotti and Hunziker are well-regarded public figures in Italy who have taken stands for LGBTQ and women’s rights. In 2017, Hunziker, who is the wife of Tomaso Trussardi ( @TheRealTrussardigram ) , CEO of Italian fashion brand @Trussardi , found herself lured into a cult who brainwashed and mentally abused her. Since her experience, the TV presenter has been active and outspoken on women’s abuse issues.</p>
                    <p>Italy is home to the largest population of Chinese people within all of Europe, with an estimated 310,000 Chinese nationals making up the country’s third largest community of foreign nationals.</p>
                    <p>Amid the country’s first wave of the coronavirus last year, local businesses began barring Chinese people from their establishments. Four governors of northern Italian regions also mandated that children returning from China do not attend school for 2 weeks, as reported by the BBC. It prompted condemnation from Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who said they had no authority to do so.</p>
