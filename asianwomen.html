                    <p>By now, you all have probably heard of the senseless shootings that targeted Asian people at massage parlors in the Atlanta area. Eight people were killed yesterday, six of whom were Asian and seven who were women. It’s important now that we understand the type of normalized racism and xenophobia that leads to violence against Asian women specifically. Unsurprisingly, Hollywood has a lot to do with it. </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p> Historically, Hollywood’s portrayal of marginalized people is almost always rooted in a complex mess of reductive stereotypes, caricatures, and misinformation, reflecting a hard truth about America and its legacy of racism. Sometimes, this manifests as “harmless jokes” like heavily accented speech or making Asian women’s genitalia a punchline. More often, they perpetuate dangerous stereotypes of Asian women as exotic beings who are either hyper-sexualized temptresses or submissive and lack any agency. These stereotypes have reverberated through our culture for decades, leaving harmful effects. </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p>This hyper-sexualized narrative leads to sexual objectification and violence. A 2016 report by the National Network to End Domestic Violence states that “the everyday racism and sexism against Asian women yields deadly results, as this dehumanization creates a climate that makes violence excusable.” The NNEDV also found that 41 to 61 percent of Asian women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime, a higher rate than any other ethnic group. </p>
                        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
                    <p>Yet, these harmful stereotypes are still commonplace in modern media to this day. Swipe through for some examples of how media’s portrayal of Asian women harm them. Unfortunately, the list goes on and on. The representation of Asian men in media is just as bad…</p>
